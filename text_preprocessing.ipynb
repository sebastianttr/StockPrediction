    "Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004 Elon Musk joined as the company's largest shareholder and in 2008 he was named CEO. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally. In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies. In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization temporarily reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history. As of 2023, it is the world's most valuable automaker. In 2022, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 18% share.\n",
    "Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, product defects, and Musk's many controversial statements.\n",

Rebecca Tinucci, who headed up Tesla\\'s charging team, was one of two women on stage for the investor day last March. \"We have understood since Day One that a great charging experience is the linchpin to electric vehicle adoption,\" Tinucci said as she walked onstage. In the subsequent year, nearly all rival automakers in the United States agreed to adopt Tesla\\'s charging standards and cut deals to let their EV buyers charge at Tesla stations. Tinucci and much of her team were sacked this week. In a posting on his social media platform X, Musk said Tesla plans \"to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.\" Another executive on the stage who left was Colin Campbell, the former vice president of powertrain engineering. The loss of so many executives is something the Tesla board should be monitoring, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \"Lots of departures very quickly suggest a problematic leadership style,\" he said. \"You shouldn\\'t lose that many people that quickly.\" With Tesla\\'s revenue, profit and share price falling, Musk has reasserted his dominance at the company. For some investors, that is more important than the executive churn. \"Elon\\'s not there and we have this turnover? That\\'s very bad,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner with Deepwater Asset Management and a Tesla investor. \"If Elon\\'s there, he\\'s going to draw on talent to keep things going so it really all comes down to Elon remaining a part of the story.\" Musk has signaled significant strategy shifts in response to falling sales and tougher competition - changes that could leave out executives running operations no longer central to the new plans. Tesla\\'s future lies in artificial intelligence and robotaxis, not conventional auto manufacturing, Musk told investors in April. Musk is putting action behind those words. He has ordered a 10% cut in staff and scrapped plans for a new, low-cost line of vehicles in favor of revamping existing models to develop lower-priced entries. Tesla said it will pause construction of new factories until the company\\'s sales had reached 3 million vehicles a year - enough to fill up the automaker\\'s existing production operations. \"If you buy the narrative that Tesla is an AI company fundamentally, it may not be cause for concern,\" said K.C. Boyce, vice president at data analytics and advisory firm Escalent. \"It fits into the idea of sizing and resourcing the business correctly to deliver on the promise of full self-driving and robotaxi.\" Other senior Tesla executives, who were not among those onstage during the 2023 investor day, have left in recent weeks. Daniel Ho, a former Ford executive and 10-year Tesla veteran who had been director of new car programs, is no longer with the company. Rohan Patel, a former Obama administration official who had been Tesla VP for public policy and key to expansion plans for India, said he is leaving. Another executive to exit was Allie Arebalo, Tesla\\'s senior director of human resources, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Martin Viecha, head of investor relations who also was on the stage last year with Musk, announced his departure at the end of an April 24 conference call with analysts. Unlike most of the other departed executives, Viecha received a warm sendoff from Musk. \"The reason I reached out to you was because I thought your analysis of Tesla was the best that I had seen,\" Musk said on the call. Some analysts said the executive team is critical given the challenges faced by the EV maker. \"Having a strong bench behind Musk is important at this pivotal time given the Category 5 storm that Tesla\\'s going through,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.'\n",

Europe today is coming to grips with the significant wins by far-right parties in the EU elections. As our colleagues reported on Sunday, “kiss goodbye to the European Green Deal”. While the significance of these elections is still being understood, they could deal a major blow to renewable energy and sustainable investing on the continent that is the world’s leader in both. For today, I have an article about one aspect of renewable energy that does not get much visibility: storage. And while we might associate batteries with electric vehicles, batteries are crucial to increasing electricity demand as well. Battery storage companies are booming, but can they catch Tesla? When most people think of Tesla they picture its electric cars (or maybe a Cybertruck. I saw my first in New York last week). And when most people think of Tesla’s competitors, Ford, General Motors and other auto manufacturers come to mind. But not Julian Nebreda, chief executive of Fluence Energy, a Virginia-based, publicly traded energy storage provider. “Tesla is probably our biggest competitor,” Nebreda told me. It is all due to Tesla’s significant — and perhaps under-appreciated — battery storage division. Tesla launched a battery storage business in 2015. In April this year, Tesla reported record energy storage revenues of $1.6bn for the first quarter. “Energy generation and storage remains our highest margin business,” the company said in an earnings report. Fluence went public in 2021 and was started by AES, a Virginia utility, and German energy company Siemens. AES started work on lithium-ion energy storage in 2007, and now Fluence is one of Wall Street’s favourite companies as it hopes to benefit from booming electricity demand underpinned by artificial intelligence. “Data centre demand is not new. What is new is the urgency,” Nebreda said. “That is where we are going to play in terms of speed and getting permits, in terms of efficiency, we are the technology that is the fastest. ”While batteries are not as visually appealing as wind turbines or solar panels, they can play a crucial role in maintaining stable supply in electricity grids that are set to rely increasingly on intermittent renewable sources. Growth in batteries dominated almost all other clean energy technologies in 2023, the International Energy Agency said in an April report. Last year, battery deployment in the energy sector increased by more than 130 per cent year over year. And while many people might associate batteries with electric cars, the energy sector accounts for more than 90 per cent of overall battery demand. The AI revolution has undeniably captivated investors around the world. Chipmaker Nvidia’s market capitalisation briefly hit $3tn last week, worth the entire French Cac 40 stocks index plus most of Germany’s Dax. Investors have been eyeing under-appreciated, “picks and shovels” companies to bet on the AI boom. Storage companies such as Fluence are rising as one such business. “We believe [Fluence] should appeal to a wide swath of investors,” those both in traditional energy and environmental, social and governance (ESG), JPMorgan said in a May 9 research report. Surging investor interest in energy storage has opened doors to different technologies. Lithium batteries such as the ones Tesla makes are not the only way to bottle up electricity. Form Energy, a Massachusetts-based storage business, sells iron-air battery technology. Form argues its batteries can last much longer than lithium and are cheaper. In December, Form won a $30mn grant from California for a project that will discharge power into the state’s grid for 100 hours. The award is part of a California Energy Commission programme dedicated specifically to investing in long-duration energy storage. And in Minnesota, Xcel Energy, a utility, is partnering with Form to deploy two iron-air battery systems at retired coal plants. “Our 100-hour, iron-air battery is designed to deliver the demand dexterity needed to allow large industrial loads to be connected quickly,” Mateo Jaramillo, Form Energy’s chief executive, told me. I spoke to Jaramillo on a video call and it was my first interview with a chief executive who was wearing a yellow safety vest. He was calling me from Form’s West Virginia facility that is under construction. According to Jaramillo, technologies already exist today that can be deployed quickly and at scale to meet rising electricity demand. For example, the excitement and investor dollars in small nuclear reactors might be overly optimistic, he said. These small modular reactors “while promising as a new grid resource, still have uncertain timelines and cost profiles”, he said. One of the challenges for companies in the renewable energy ecosystem is trade restrictions. “Geopolitics is a headwind,” Nebreda said, since some Fluence parts are coming from China. “We work with a global supply chain and that is important to deliver products at good prices,” he said. “A world in which you cannot send things around effectively is a worry.” Another hurdle is cheap electricity. In some parts of the US, energy capacity costs “have just fallen through the floor,” PJ Deschenes, a managing director in Nomura’s “greentech” division, told me. For some investors, there was not enough pricing power to motivate new battery investments on their own, “and that is a problem”, he said. “You will ultimately need a more clear payment for capacity in the system,” Deschenes said.If electricity grids are hit by extreme weather or crack because of a crisis, surging prices could force the need for more batteries, he said. “It is one thing if you are paying 20 cents a kilowatt hour. It is another if you have to pay $5.” The biggest challenge for storage companies might be keeping up with Tesla. Nebreda acknowledged that Tesla also did residential battery storage, and “clearly their cost of capital is much better than ours”. As critical as batteries were for renewable energy storage, “the challenge is how new entrants compete with incumbents such as Tesla”, as well as BYD, China’s rival electric-vehicle manufacturer, said Arash Nazhad, a managing director at Moelis who co-leads the company’s cleantech group. Elon Musk’s company is clearly a juggernaut. But the evolution of competing energy storage companies will have ramifications for the global clean energy transition in ways that do not involve electric vehicles. (Patrick Temple-West)\"\n",
